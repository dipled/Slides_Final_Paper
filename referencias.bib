abstract = {We introduce and describe the alternating fixpoint of a logic program with negation. The underlying idea is to monotonically build up a set of negative conclusions until the least fixpoint is reached, using a transformation related to the one that defines stable models, developed by Gelfand and Lifschitz. From a fixed set of negative conclusions, we can derive the positive conclusions that follow (without deriving any further negative ones), by traditional Horn clause semantics. The union of positive and negative conclusions is called the alternating fixpoint partial model. The name “alternating” was chosen because the transformation runs in two passes; the first pass transforms an underestimate of the set of negative conclusions into an (intermediate) overestimate; the second pass transforms the overestimates into a new underestimate; the composition of the two passes is monotonic.Our main theorem is that the alternating fixpoint partial model is exactly the well-founded partial model.We also show that a system is fixpoint logic, which permits rule bodies to be first order formulas but requires inductive relations to be positive within them, can be transformed straightforwardly into a normal logic program whose alternating fixpoint partial model corresponds to the least fixpoint of the fixpoint logic system. Thus alternating fixpoint logic is at least as expressive as fixpoint logic. The converse is shown to hold for finite structures.},

abstract="This paper describes a general assignment method for combining evidences in the form of mass assignments over the power set, P (X), of a set of labels. It also describes an iterative assignment method for updating an apriori assignment over P (X) with evidences E1, ..., Er all expressed as assignments over P (X). This can be thought of as an extension of Bayesian updating with uncertain information. A minimum relative information optimisation of the updated assignment relative to the apriori is used. The methods have application to knowledge engineering for processing rules with uncertainties, causal nets and other representations for inference purposes. Solutions to the non-monotonic logic and abduction problems are special cases of this inference process. The methods are not the same as the Dempster Shafer theory of evidential reasoning, [Shafer 1976] but does use Shafer's belief function form of representing uncertainty.",

    abstract = {The problem of disjoint sets, also known as union-find, consists in maintaining a partition of a finite set within a data structure. This structure provides two operations: a function find returning the class of an element and a function union merging two classes. An optimal and imperative solution is known since 1975. However, the imperative nature of this data structure may be a drawback when it is used in a backtracking algorithm. This paper details the implementation of a persistent union-find data structure as efficient as its imperative counterpart. To achieve this result, our solution makes heavy use of imperative features and thus it is a significant example of a data structure whose side effects are safely hidden behind a persistent interface. To strengthen this last claim, we also detail a formalization using the Coq proof assistant which shows both the correctness of our solution and its observational persistence.},

In particular, we formalize a meta-theorem that allows us to reduce the infinite number of truth values to a finite number of truth values, for a given formula, and we use this result in a formalization of a small case study.",

A paraconsistent approach for knowledge base integration allows keeping inconsistent information and reasoning in its presence. In this paper, we use a paraconsistent logic (LFI1) as the underlying logic for the specification of P-Datalog, a deductive query language for databases containing inconsistent information. We present a declarative semantics which captures the desired meaning of a recursive query executed over a database containing inconsistent facts and whose rules allow inferring information from inconsistent premises. We also present a bottom-up evaluation method for P-Datalog programs based on an alternating fixpoint operator.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the paraconsistent annotated evidential logic (PAL Eτ) research. This non-classical logic has gained attention in several real-world applications, including robotics, intelligent control, decision-making systems, pattern recognition and classification, and medical diagnosis, among others. The low-complexity mathematics and small computational resources required by PAL Eτ algorithms make them interesting for expert systems, edge computing, and tiny machine learning (Tiny ML) design. This paper aims to present the recent work in the field of PAL Eτ, from its theoretical grounding to practical applications, as well as challenges and trends for this logic. This paper provides a multilevel platform for researchers interested in this area.}

    abstract = {Three-valued logics arise in several fields of computer science, both inspired by concrete problems (such as in the management of the null value in databases) and theoretical considerations. Several three-valued logics have been defined. They differ by their choice of basic connectives, hence also from a syntactic and proof-theoretic point of view. Different interpretations of the third truth value have also been suggested. They often carry an epistemic flavor. In this work, relationships between logical connectives on three-valued functions are explored. Existing theorems of functional completeness have laid bare some of these links, based on specific connectives. However we try to draw a map of such relationships between conjunctions, negations and implications that extend Boolean ones. It turns out that all reasonable connectives can be defined from a few of them and so all known three-valued logics appear as a fragment of only one logic. These results can be instrumental when choosing, for each application context, the appropriate fragment where the basic connectives make full sense, based on the appropriate meaning of the third truth-value.}

If we consider multiple-conclusion consequence relations, the dual properties of those above mentioned are ⊢ φ,¬φ and ¬(ψ∨¬ψ) ⊢. We call genuine paracomplete logics those rejecting the mentioned properties. We present here an analysis of the three-valued genuine paracomplete logics.}

A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},
